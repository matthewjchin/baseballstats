<h1>Baseball Statistics</h1>
An analysis on the last 150 years of Major League Baseball and the impact that slugging and hitting percentages of batters are in terms of Sabermetrics and other sports statistics.

<br>

The following statistics in the Jupyter notebook titled Slugging.ipynb are: On-Base Percentage (OBP), Slugging Percentage (SLG), and On-base Plus Slugging (OPS) Percentage.

<br>

Over the course of time, this repository will contain code regarding prediction models, statistical analysis, player profiles, and data visualization of certain key components of Sabermetrics.

<br>

[Buster Posey](https://www.mlb.com/player/buster-posey-457763), former catcher of the San Francisco Giants (2009-2019, 2021), has been used in examples of data visualization. A three-time World Series Champion, seven-time All-Star and five-time Silver Slugger, some of his statistics have been and will be used as part of a small sample of one of the greatest catchers of all time. 

<br>

[Brandon Crawford](https://www.mlb.com/player/brandon-crawford-543063), shortstop of the San Francisco Giants, has been used as an example of the slugging statistics as well as data visualization that used in Sabermetrics, Gold Glove and All-Star selections as a two-time World Series Champion. Below is data showing his on-base plus slugging percentage in his current twelve-year career with the Giants:

[Hunter Pence](https://www.mlb.com/player/hunter-pence-452254), 14-year MLB veteran right fielder, has also been used as an example of the slugging statistics that are used in individual Sabermetrics examples, also a two-time World Series Champion.
