# slugging-stats
An analysis on the last 150 years of Major League Baseball and the impact that slugging and hitting percentages of batters are in terms of Sabermetrics and other sports statistics.

Inspired by the repository [Basics of Sabermetrics](https://github.com/rberns28/Basics-of-Sabermetrics) by [Ryan Berns](https://github.com/rberns28). 

A forked repository from Berns inspired the creation of this repo, which can be found [here](https://github.com/matthewjchin/Basics-of-Sabermetrics).
