Project Ideas

The following are the ideas that can be added to this project:

1. Predicting if batters with higher BBs were more likely to be finalists/winners of the AL/NL MVP award.
2. Determining if higher OBP (not OPS) was result of the MVP finalists as they weres
3. Analysis on how often MVP winners were from non-playoff teams
4. Is there too much emphasis on games won by pitcher in terms of Cy Young award winner for each league?
5. Why are home runs and extra base hits more important in determining Silver Slugger or MVP awards?
6. Predict the stats of players in 2020 season based on data from 2015-2019, had the 2020 season been a full 162-game season.
